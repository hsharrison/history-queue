class HistoryQueue:
    def __init__(self, history_size=None, max_backlog=0, loop=None):
        """``asyncio.Queue`` with history.

        Objects put on a ``HistoryQueue`` are gathered in tuples,
        with the first element being the next item on the queue,
        followed by items add previously.

        ``HistoryQueue`` can also be thought of as as asynchronous ``collections.deque``,
        with ``put`` analogous to ``deque.appendleft``
        and ``get`` returning the entire deque (as a tuple).

        Up to ``history_size + 1`` items are returned in each tuple.
        If `history_size` is ``None``, then each tuple will contain the entire history of the queue.

        If `max_backlog` is less than or equal to zero, the queue size is infinite.
        If it is an integer greater than ``0``,
        then ``await put()``will block when the queue contains `max_backlog` items,
        until an item is removed by ``get``.

        If the queue is empty, ``await get()`` will block until an item is added to the queue.

        Parameters
        ----------
        history_size : int, optional
            The number of items, in addition to the "current" item, to return from ``get``.
            When `history_size` is ``None``, then entire history is returned.
            Serves a similar purpose as ``collections.deque.maxlen``.
        max_backlog : int, optional
            The number of items to save before the queue is considered full.
            If `max_backlog` is ``0``, the queue is never full.
            Analogous to ``asyncio.Queue.maxsize``.
        loop : ``asyncio.BaseEventLoop``, optional
            The event loop that will be managing the queue.

        Attributes
        ----------
        history_size
        max_backlog

        Raises
        ------
        ``QueueEmpty``
            When ``get_nowait`` is called on an empty queue.
        ``QueueFull``
            When ``put_nowait`` is called on a full queue.

        See Also
        --------
        ``asyncio.Queue``
        ``collections.deque``

        Notes
        -----
        This class is ``not thread safe``.

        Examples
        --------
        For ease of illustration, in these examples we use ``put_nowait`` and ``get_nowait``,
        the synchronous counterparts of ``put`` and ``wait``, respectively.
        In a coroutine, ``await put()`` could be used to block until the queue is not full,
        and ``await get()`` to block until there is an item in the queue.

        >>> hq = HistoryQueue(history_size=2)
        >>> hq.put_nowait(0)

        >>> hq.get_nowait()
